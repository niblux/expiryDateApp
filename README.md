# Expiry Date Application

This application will allow users to upload pantry cupboard items, dispensables all the types of food that have a short shelf life.

The idea being instead of having to remember to replace these items you can add, delete or update items and by providing the expiry date the user is reminded via notifications to replace the items.

Key features:
Add, Delete , Update Items 
Receive push notifications when items expire
Search for all items by name, category or expiry date

Possible future work, is to include a search functionality connected to a supermarket api allowing the user to search for items and add the items directly without having to add them manually.
